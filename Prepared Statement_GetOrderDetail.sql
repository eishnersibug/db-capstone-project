#Little Lemon need you to help them to create a prepared statement called GetOrderDetail. This prepared statement will help to reduce the parsing time of queries. It will also help to secure the database from SQL injections.
#
#The prepared statement should accept one input argument, the CustomerID value, from a variable. 
#
#The statement should return the order id, the quantity and the order cost from the Orders table.â€¯
#
#Once you create the prepared statement, you can create a variable called id and assign it value of 1.

PREPARE GetOrderDetail FROM "SELECT OrderID, Quantity, TotalCost FROM Orders WHERE CustomerID = ?";

SET @id = 1;

EXECUTE GetOrderDetail using @id;
